EmulateHTML5 Native Loader and Examples
===

This repository contains the Native Loader javascript code along with some example code.

To check out this repository, run the following mercurial command:

    hg clone https://emulate-html5.googlecode.com/hg/ emulate-html5

Source code:
---
The JavaScript code is contained in the js/ directory and can be read from there.

Example files:
---
Out of the box only the *-remote.html example files will work. For the *-local.html examples to work you will need checkouts of yui3 and yui3-gallery in adjacent folders to your emulate-html5 checkout. For example if you have checked out this repository to /home/fred/checkouts/emulate-html5 then you would need to run:

    git checkout git://github.com/yui/yui3.git /home/fred/checkouts/yui3
    git checkout git://github.com/yui/yui3-gallery.git /home/fred/checkouts/yui3-gallery

Re-creating javascript files:
---
The JavaScript files (native.js, native-local.js, native-min.js, native-local-min.js) are generated by createNative.sh from the files in the includes/ directory and from the gallery-emulatehtml5-loader in the yui3-gallery repository. Therefore to create these files again you need to have a checkout of yui3-gallery as explained above.

Once you have a yui3-gallery checkout in a directory adjacent to your emulate-html5 directory, simply run:

    cd <path-to-your-emulate-html5-directory>;
    createNative.sh; # Must be run from within the emulate-html5 directory
